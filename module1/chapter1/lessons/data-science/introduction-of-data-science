- Add to cart
- Payment
- Product reaches the nearest delivery center
- Delivered

**At each step is data is generated and stored for further usage**

**In this process -** 

- Software Engineers - Will develop the application(Mobile / Web) to facilitate the process

- Data Engineers - Will ensure data generated at each step is stored in right format or structure

- Data Analyst/ Scientist - Will derive the insights using the data stored

2.) What is insight?

     An insight refers to a deep understanding derived from analyzing data.
     It involves uncovering patterns, trends, or relationships that can inform decision-making, provide strategic direction, or solve specific problems within an organisation.

Ex -
