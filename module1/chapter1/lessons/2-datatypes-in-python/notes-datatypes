1.) Data Types: Unit of Information

Int (Whole numbers) : -infinity…-2,-1,0, 1,2,3…Infinity

Float(Decimal Numbers) : -2.34, -5.4, -1.2, 6.7, 8.9

String(text) : “AlmaBetter”, “Data Science”, etc 

Boolean: True, False

List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set : These are specific to Python | Will be discussed in further classes


2.)  Operators: action on data

 Arithmetic Operators : `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `**`, `//` 

Important : % (Modulo Operator : Remainder), // (Floor Division Operator : Quotient)

Comparison Operators : > , < , ==, ! =, > =, < =

Assignment Operators : =


3.)  Variables: Space where data is stored.

Naming and assigning values (x = 5, name = "John").

Important: Variable is like a empty container in which value is stored.

Example: x = 5, it means value 5 is stored in variable x

Here, some rules to naming a variable -

- Variables names must start with a letter or an underscore like _ product , product_
- The remainder of your variable name may consist of letters, numbers and underscores
- spacy1, pyThon,machine_learning are some valid variable names
- Names are case sensitive. (It means XY, xY, Xy, xy : all 4 are different variables) :Captial and small is considered different
- It's a best practice to create a variable that should be coherent with the context you are working on. Let's say you are working with fruit data; the variable name should be "fruit" or "fruit_mango." | Make it as meaningful as you can.
- Names cannot begin with a number. Python will throw an error when you try to do so
- Names can not contain spaces, use _ (underscore) instead
- Names can not contain any of these symbols:                 :'",<>/?|\!@#%^&*~-+
- It is considered best practice that names are lowercase with underscores- ex: (total_ , no_of_apples, etc)
- There are some restricted keywords in python only reserved for python, you cannot use it for variables,


4.) Functions: Set of Instructions written in Input & Output format**

Example -

print() —> It is function which takes input and displays the values in it.

x = 5

print(x) —→ Displays the value of stored in x

type(x) —> Displays the data type of the value stored in x



5.) Syntax & Rules : Grammar of writing python language

Over the time we will learn the syntax of writing python code.

There are certain rules that have to followed.

Example - 

P  - Parenthesis (bracket)

E - Exponential (**) Power

MD - Multiplication, Division, Modulo, Floor Division

AS - Addition, Subtraction
