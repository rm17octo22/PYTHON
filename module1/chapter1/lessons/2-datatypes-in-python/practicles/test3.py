Kids on a picnic decided to play fun game and find the area of circle they are sitting on. 
Assume the radius of circle to be some floating numbers.

Area of a Circle

In geometry, the area enclosed by a circle of radius r is πr2. 
Here the Greek letter π represents a constant, approximately equal to 3.14159,
 which is equal to the ratio of the circumference of any circle to its diameter.


Input:
1.1

"""
pi = 3.14159

# Take the input as radius from the user
r = float(input())

# Calculate the area of circle
area= pi * r**2

# Print the output
print(area)

"""
# Write your code here

pi = 3.14159

# Take the input as radius from the user
r = float(input())
print(pi*r*r)
