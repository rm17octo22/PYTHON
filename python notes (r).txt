1.) compiler v/s intreputer

compiler :-translate code before the program runs
	    it is faster then intreputer
	(high-level programming language into machine code)
	
intreputer :- translate code line-by-line as the code runs (python)
		it is slower then complier
	(high-level programming language into machine code)

2.) what is cloud ?
ans :- cloud is a physical setup.
       lotup(many akeres) sapce require for cloud setup
       laptop,ram,disk space,multi processor etc ..part of cloud physical setup
       cloud is one type of virtual space
       ex:- my some store data in google drive and 
	    google drive need google data store for data store in virtual space.
	cloud name:
		   aws >>>> amazon
		   google drive >>>>> google
	           asure >>> microsoft
		   one drive.....

3.) what is diagnostics and predictive ?
ans:- diagnostic analysis:- this type data collection is past and present data.
			    this type data is used for what is current sutivation now.
    ex:- doctor to patient says some information reagarding his body.
	what is problem in your body?
	
      predictiv analysis:- this type data collect from diagnostics analysis and
                          after predict what is possbility in future using algoridham...
   ex:- a company past data is collect after predict 
		how many growth of compeny in future?
		how many sales growth of compeny in future?
		which type product is treanding in future?

4.) da v/s ds

data analysist:- data anlysis role in industry is data stored as human readeble format like excel,...
		 diagnostic anylisys in use for data anylisist. 

data scientist:- data scientist role in industry is recive data from data anaylisys and predict the future according to algoridham and
		 convert data into human readable form like excel,charts,pattern,etc .....
		pridictive anylysis in use for data scientist.

5.) what is insight?
ans:- An insight refers to a deep understanding derived from analyzing data. It involves uncovering patterns, trends,
      or relationships that can inform decision-making, provide strategic direction, or solve specific problems within an organisation.

6.)what is PEMDAS RULE?
  P = PERENTHISIS(OUTER PERENTHSIS BEFORE SOLVE INNER PERENTHSIS) 
  E = EXPONTIONAL
  M = MULITIPLICATION (LEFT TO RIGHT)
  D = DIVISION (LEFT TO RIGHT)
  A = ADDITION(LEFT TO RIGHT)
  S = SUBTRACTION(LEFT TO RIGHT)
		
7.) DESCRIBE VARIABLE RULES.
ans:- variable start with (a-z) characteter is valid >>>>> ravi12 , ra_vi , RAVI 
      variable start with _ (underscore) is valid    >>>>> _RAVI12 ,ra_vi12
      
      variable start with number is not valid >>>>> 12ravi
      variable start with space is not valid >>>>> ra vi
      variable start with special symbol is not valid >>>>> $ravi ,@ravi

8.)data types-------------------------------------
	|					  |
	|					  |
    premitive datatypes			 nonpremitive datatypes
	|					  |
	|					  |
     integer(int)			    string(str)
      float				        list
    boolean (bool)				tuple
						set
					  dictionary(dict)

   int:number without decimal .... 12,-23,0

   float : number with decimal ..... -23.32,44.44

   boolean : true/false;yes/no;on/off ..... bool

   string : 1 element can store multiple character ..... 
            ravi = "12"
	    x = 'mr'
	    y = '''
                  hello,
			MY NAME IS xexagon
		'''
   list : store all datatype,ordered/indexed,mutable,repeated
  	    list12 = [12,34,'ravi',45.43]
   
   tuple : store all datatype,ordered/indexed,immutable,repeated
	    tuple12 = (12,34.43,'mr')

   set : store all datatype,unordered,mutable, not reapaeated,not indexing
	    set12 = {12,32.43,"m1221m"}

   dictonary : store all datatype,unordered,mutable, keys >>> immutable (expect : list,set,dict ) ,not keys repeated ,not indexing 5
		items,keys,values >>>>>> 
		{key:value} >>>>>> 1 element in dictionary
		{key:value,key:value} >>>>>>> 2 element in dictionary
	    dict12 = {12:34,'rollno' : 21 , "name" : "ravi" , -2.2 : 34}

9)   difference between len(),range(),indexing,slicing.
ans :-  len () function  >>>>>>>>>>> count no.of elements in variable.....start count element to 1
	range(strat,stop,step) :- generate a seqence of number ...... ex.) range(5) .... o/p >> 0,1,2,3,4.... start with 0.
       positive indexing : start with first element '0' to 'n+1'........i = start , j = stop (j+1) , k = step
       negative indexing : last element start with "-1,-2,....so on ...... i = start , j = stop (j-1) , k = step
 
10.) what is identifier ?
ans:- Python Identifier is the name we give to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
      That means whenever we want to give an entity a name, that's called identifier. 
      A python identifier is a name given to various entities.
      like variables, functions, and classes.

11.) what is difference between function and method???
ans:-

12.) what is difference between (=) and (==) ????
ans:- = is a assignment operator.its use in python is assign value store in variable
      == is a comparison operator. its use in python compare of two varibale and it will give output is bool (True/False)

13.) what is mongodb?
ans:-  relational :- data sciense(ds) and data anylysis(da) is mostly work with this environment
		  :- SQL preffered for this environment
		  :- format >>>> like excel .... raw,column

   non-relational :- web devloper is mostly work with this environment
		  :- mongodb preffered for this environment
		  :- format >>>> like dictionary,json format {:}

14.)  what is buffer memory ???
ans:- 

15.) what means of case sensitivie in python???
ans:- case sensetive means all capitel letter and small letter are different .
       ex:- Ravi =12 & ravi = 12 >>>>> both varible consider as a different variable .
