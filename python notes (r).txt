1.) compiler v/s intreputer

compiler :-translate code before the program runs
	    it is faster then intreputer
	(high-level programming language into machine code)
	
intreputer :- translate code line-by-line as the code runs (python)
		it is slower then complier
	(high-level programming language into machine code)

2.) what is cloud ?
ans :- cloud is a physical setup.
       lotup(many akeres) sapce require for cloud setup
       laptop,ram,disk space,multi processor etc ..part of cloud physical setup
       cloud is one type of virtual space
       ex:- my some store data in google drive and 
	    google drive need google data store for data store in virtual space.
	cloud name:
		   aws >>>> amazon
		   google drive >>>>> google
	           asure >>> microsoft
		   one drive.....

3.) what is diagnostics and predictive ?
ans:- diagnostic analysis:- this type data collection is past and present data.
			    this type data is used for what is current sutivation now.
    ex:- doctor to patient says some information reagarding his body.
	what is problem in your body?
	
      predictiv analysis:- this type data collect from diagnostics analysis and
                          after predict what is possbility in future using algoridham...
   ex:- a company past data is collect after predict 
		how many growth of compeny in future?
		how many sales growth of compeny in future?
		which type product is treanding in future?

4.) da v/s ds

5.) what is insight?
ans:-

6.)what is PEMDAS RULE?
  P = PERENTHISIS(OUTER PERENTHSIS BEFORE SOLVE INNER PERENTHSIS) 
  E = EXPONTIONAL
  M = MULITIPLICATION (LEFT TO RIGHT)
  D = DIVISION (LEFT TO RIGHT)
  A = ADDITION(LEFT TO RIGHT)
  S = SUBTRACTION(LEFT TO RIGHT)
		
7.) DESCRIBE VARIABLE RULES.
ans:- variable start with (a-z) characteter is valid
      variable start with _ (underscore) is valid
      
      variable start with number is not valid >>>>> 12ravi
      variable start with space is not valid >>>>> ra vi
      variable start with special symbol is not valid >>>>> $ravi ,@ravi

8.)data types
   int:number without decimal .... 12,-23,0
   float : number with decimal ..... -23.32,44.44
   boolean : true/false;yes/no;on/off ..... bool
   string : 1 element can store multiple character ..... 
            ravi = "12"
	    x = 'mr'
	    y = '''
                  hello,
			MY NAME IS xexagon
		'''
   list : store all datatype,ordered/indexed,mutable
  	    list12 = [12,34,'ravi',45.43]
   
   tuple : store all datatype,ordered/indexed,immutable
	    tuple12 = (12,34.43,'mr')

   set : store all datatype,unordered,mutable
	    set12 = {12,32.43,"m1221m"}

   dictonary : store all datatype,unordered,mutable,
		items,keys,values >>>>>> {key:value}
	    dict12 = {12:34,'rollno' : 21 , "name" : "ravi" , -2.2 : 34}

9) indexing and slicing

   positive indexing : start with first element '0' to 'n+1'
   negative indexing : last element start with "-1"
 
10.) what is identifier ?
ans:- Python Identifier is the name we give to identify a variable, function, class, module or other object.
      That means whenever we want to give an entity a name, that's called identifier. 
      A python identifier is a name given to various entities.
      like variables, functions, and classes.
